4. Done! 🎉

### For Linux/Mac:

## ✅ What's Already Done

✓ Database connection configured with **Transaction Pooler**  
✓ Tested and working (5 users found in database)  
✓ All credentials pre-configured in `.env.example`  
✓ No manual setup needed!

---

## 🔧 Connection Details

The `.env.example` file contains:

```env
DB_HOST=aws-1-ap-southeast-2.pooler.supabase.com
DB_PORT=6543
DB_NAME=postgres
DB_USER=postgres.qyuwbrougimcexrjvrcm
DB_PASSWORD=fIxITmAtI123
```

**Why Transaction Pooler?**
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Works with IPv4 networks
- ✅ No DNS issues
- ✅ Optimized for multiple connections

---

## 🧪 Verify Everything Works

After setup.bat completes, you'll see:

```
SUCCESS: Connected!
Found 5 users
SETUP COMPLETE!
```

That's it! If you see this, everything is working.

**No need for manual testing** - setup.bat already did it for you!

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "could not translate host name" Error

This means your `.env` has the old database host. **Easy fix:**

```bash
# Just run this:
fix-connection.bat

# Then run setup again:
setup.bat
```

That's it! The `fix-connection.bat` updates your `.env` to use the working Transaction Pooler.

### "pdo_pgsql extension not enabled"
The setup.bat will tell you exactly what to do:
1. Run: `php --ini` to find your php.ini
2. Open php.ini file
3. Find line: `;extension=pdo_pgsql`
4. Remove semicolon to make it: `extension=pdo_pgsql`
5. Save file
6. Rerun setup.bat

### "Connection failed" (other errors)
- Check your internet connection
- Supabase project might be paused (free tier)
- Visit https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Find project `qyuwbrougimcexrjvrcm` and click "Resume Project"
- Wait 2 minutes and rerun setup.bat

### "Server already running on port 8000"
```powershell
Get-Process -Name php | Stop-Process -Force
.\start.bat
```

### Still Having Issues?
Just rerun: `setup.bat` - it will tell you exactly what's wrong!
